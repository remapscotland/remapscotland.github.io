{"name":"REMAP Scotland Web","tagline":"","body":"### This Document \r\n\r\nJust a simple guide to help simplify things so following the progress of the work is a clear and straightforward job.\r\n\r\nQ. What is the repository anyway?\r\n\r\nA. Essentially it is just a folder containing a 'package' in our case the package is a web application which will contain the website and database archives of REMAP Scotland and its cases. The main branch is often referred to as 'master'... Shall we move on?\r\n\r\n#### The 'web' Repository\r\n[web](https://github.com/remapscotland/web)\r\nThis is where the work you see published on http://remapscotland.org.uk goes. \r\nNothing should go on the site without being pushed to 'master' on this repository\r\n\r\n#### The 'wip' Repository\r\n[wip](https://github.com/remapscotland/wip)\r\nThe wip repository is for 'work in progress'. The site is too young to start using it yet but expect most work to move there once we have a structure which complies with accessibility standards and holds enough content to qualify as a suitable front end.\r\n\r\n#### The 'remapGit' Repository\r\n[remapGit](https://github.com/remapscotland/remapGit)\r\nThis repository is for miscellaneous useful scripts. I could not think of a good name at that time, sorry.\r\n\r\n#### Issues\r\n[web/issues]( https://github.com/remapscotland/web/issues)\r\nThis is where bugs will be tracked and filed and also where feature requests will be made and discussed among the developers.\r\n\r\n#### Wiki: Introduction/Welcome Page\r\n[/wiki/REMAP-Scotland-Web](https://github.com/remapscotland/web/wiki/REMAP-Scotland-Web)\r\nThis is the general description of the plans and the organisation management of REMAPScotland at github and on-line.\r\n\r\n#### Links: Useful Web Resources\r\n[Useful-Web-Resources](https://github.com/remapscotland/web/wiki/Useful-Web-Resources)\r\nExactly that.\r\n\r\n#### History: Wiki\r\n[wiki/_history](https://github.com/remapscotland/web/wiki/_history)\r\nThis is the history of the wiki\r\n\r\n#### History: Commits\r\n[commits/master](https://github.com/remapscotland/web/commits/master)\r\nIs where the changes to  you can see, I write a brief sentence for every new commit I make so it is easy to go back to an older version if needed\r\n\r\n#### Features and Enhancements\r\n[web/issues/milestones](https://github.com/remapscotland/web/issues/milestones)\r\nWe can set milestones to help us focus on tasks over a realistic time period.\r\n\r\n###### Current\r\nThe current version is 0.0.1, which means small milestones must be achieved by 0.0.2 \r\nThe first set of specific, achievable tasks to aim to have completed for 0.1.0 (about 6 months from now).\r\n\r\n#### History: Website Code\r\n[web/commits/master](https://github.com/remapscotland/web/commits/master)\r\nHere is the history log of all commits to the web repository thus far.
